# GeneticAlgImagePro
The objective of this program is to compute an image, using a basic genetic algorithm approach, that is close to a given image.

In a genetic algorithm, a population of individuals evolves over time. The stronger individuals reproduce, and the weaker ones die. The surviving ones can also mutate. With each individual, there is a fitness number that indicates how strong that individual is. A genetic algorithm terminates when a given number of iterations is reached or when a solution is found, that is, an individual with certain fitness.
